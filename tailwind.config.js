"Build me a clean, responsive dashboard UI using TailwindCSS in my Next.js app. It should have a sidebar with navigation links (Dashboard, Upload Data, Forecasts, Products) and a main content area with a placeholder welcome message. Add basic layout using app/layout.tsx if it exists, and use functional components. Prioritize simplicity and readability."
